  scannedb-ok extracts the text from a PDF and was written to work for scanned
  books from books.google.com. There are options for stripping of page headers
  and footers in order to make the pure text ready for text mining and NLP. Take
  care of the parentheses, square brackets and pipes in the usage note.
  Parentheses group options together, the pipe divides (groups of options) into
  alternatives. Square brackets mean that the option is optional. There are two
  input formats, pdf and xml. There are six output formats: --text which is the
  default, --no-spaces for scriptura continua, --statistics for information on
  each page, --spacing for csv output with information on glyphs an inter-glyph
  spacing, --glyphs for an internal representation of glyphs, --tokens for
  output of a list of words which can be reused for repairing syllable
  divisions. There are two modes of line detection: -i for categorization of
  lines into headline, footline etc., -C for no such categorization at all.
  These modes have various options. The order of the command line arguments does
  not matter.

Available options:
  -h,--help                Show this help text
  -p,--pdf                 PDF input data. (Default)
  -x,--xml                 XML input data. An XML representation of the glyphs
                           of a PDF file, like produced with PDFMiner's
                           "pdf2txt.py -t xml ..." command.
  -t,--text                Extract text. (Default)
  --no-spaces              Extract text without spaces. (PDF really does not
                           even know the concept of spaces!)
  --statistics             Show statistics about the text.
  --spacing                Extract inter-glyph distances for statistical
                           analysis. This generates CSV output.
  --glyphs                 Show the information about the glyphs found in the
                           document.
  --tokens                 Generate a list of tokens from the document.
  -r,--pages PAGES         Ranges of pages to extract. Defaults to all.
                           Examples: 3-9 or -10 or 2,4,6,20-30,40- or "*" for
                           all. Except for all do not put into quotes.
  -l,--lines-per-page LINES
                           Lines per page. Lines of a vertically filled page.
                           This does not need to be exact. (default: 42)
  --threshold THRESHOLD    A threshold value important for the identification of
                           lines by the internal clustering algorithm:
                           Fail-OCRed glyphs between the lines may disturb the
                           separation of lines. Instead of 0, the threshold
                           value of is used to separate the clusters. If set to
                           high, short lines may be dropped of. (default: 2)
  -k,--keep-single-glyphs-lines
                           Do not drop glyphs found between the lines. By
                           default, lines with a count of glyphs under THRESHOLD
                           are dropped.
  --steps-per-line STEPS   With the STEPS per line you may tweak the clustering
                           algorithm for the indentification of
                           lines. (default: 5)
  -f,--spacing-factor SPACING
                           A fixed spacing factor. If the distance between two
                           glyphs exceeds the product of the first glyphs width
                           and this factor, a space is inserted. For Gothic
                           letter scanned by google values down to 1 are
                           promising. (default: 1.3)
  -i,--by-indent           Categorize lines by their indentation. (Default)
  --par-indent PARINDENT   Minimal indentation of the first line of a new the
                           paragraph. In portion of a quad or 'em' (dt.
                           Geviert). This is the most important parameter to
                           tinker with. (default: 3.0)
  --custos-indent CUSTOSINDENT
                           Minimal indentation of the custos (dt. Kustode), i.e.
                           the first syllable of the next page in the bottom
                           line. In portion of the page width. (default: 0.667)
  --sig-indent SIGINDENT   Minimal indentation of the sheet signature in portion
                           of the page width. (default: 3.33e-2)
  --sig-filling SIGFILL    Maximal filling of the bottom line if it's a sheet
                           signature. (default: 0.333)
  --quote-parsing          Use this option if you want to parse for block
                           quotes. (Experimental) This might interfere with the
                           parsing for new paragraphs. The difference is that a
                           block quote's font size is assumed to be a few
                           smaller. But clustering for the base font size is
                           still experimental and has no good results for gothic
                           script.
  -M,--drop-margin         Drop glyphs found outside of the type area. The type
                           area is determined by a clustering algorithm which
                           assumes that the most lines completely fill the type
                           area horizontally. Do not use this switch, if this is
                           not the case for your text. It may produce errors on
                           pages with only one or two lines.
  --head-keep-page         Keep only the page number found in the headline.
                           (Default)
  --head-drop              Drop the whole headline.
  --head-keep              Keep the whole headline.
  --foot-keep-page         Keep only the page number found in the footline.
                           (Default)
  --foot-drop              Drop the whole footline.
  --foot-keep              Keep the whole footline.
  --custos-drop            Drop the custos, i.e. the bottom line which contains
                           the first syllable of the next page. (Default)
  --custos-keep            Keep the custos.
  --sig-drop               Drop the sheet signature in the bottom line.
                           (Default)
  --sig-keep               Keep the sheet signature.
  --page-pre PAGEPRE       The prefix for the page number if only the number is
                           kept of a head- or footline. (default: "[[")
  --page-post PAGEPOST     The postfix for the page number if only the number is
                           kept of a head- or footline. (default: "]]")
  --par PAR                The prefix for linearizing the first line of a
                           paragraph. (default: "\n\t")
  --custos CUSTOS          The prefix for linearizing the
                           custos. (default: "\t\t\t\t\t")
  --sig SIG                The prefix for linearizing the sheet
                           signature. (default: "\t\t\t")
  --blockquote BLOCKQUOTE  The prefix for linearizing a block
                           quote. (default: "\t\t$$")
  -w,--word-pool WORDPOOL  If a path to file with a pool of words (tokens) is
                           given, syllable division is repaired in the text
                           output, but only when line categorization is turned
                           on.
  -D,--no-division-mark-required
                           Use this switch, if syllable division is to be
                           repaired for lines without dash mark.
  -C,--no-categorization   Do not categorize the lines at all.
  --headlines HEADLINES    Count of lines in the page header to be
                           dropped. (default: 0)
  --footlines FOOTLINES    Count of lines in the page footer to be
                           dropped. (default: 0)
  --nlp                    Convient toggle for NLP-friendly output when
                           categorizing lines by-indent (see -i) and drop page
                           signature, drop custos, no indentation of categorized
                           lines. This sets PAR to newline "\n" and BLOCKQUOTE
                           to the empty string "".
  INFILE                   Path to the input file.

  scannedb-ok stats shows statistics about the text.

Available options:
  -h,--help                Show this help text
  -p,--pdf                 PDF input data. (Default)
  -x,--xml                 XML input data. An XML representation of the glyphs
                           of a PDF file, like produced with PDFMiner's
                           "pdf2txt.py -t xml ..." command.
  -r,--pages PAGES         Ranges of pages to extract. Defaults to all.
                           Examples: 3-9 or -10 or 2,4,6,20-30,40- or "*" for
                           all. Except for all do not put into quotes.
  -l,--lines-per-page LINES
                           Lines per page. Lines of a vertically filled page.
                           This does not need to be exact. (default: 42)
  --threshold THRESHOLD    A threshold value important for the identification of
                           lines by the internal clustering algorithm:
                           Fail-OCRed glyphs between the lines may disturb the
                           separation of lines. Instead of 0, the threshold
                           value of is used to separate the clusters. If set to
                           high, short lines may be dropped of. (default: 2)
  -k,--keep-single-glyphs-lines
                           Do not drop glyphs found between the lines. By
                           default, lines with a count of glyphs under THRESHOLD
                           are dropped.
  --steps-per-line STEPS   With the STEPS per line you may tweak the clustering
                           algorithm for the indentification of
                           lines. (default: 5)
  INFILE                   Path to the input file.
